## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Wafers**: Semiconductor wafers with specifications
- **Inspections**: Inspection processes and results
- **Defects**: Defect details with coordinates and severity
- **Equipment**: Inspection equipment and maintenance
- **Users**: System users and authentication

### Key Relationships
- Wafers have multiple Inspections
- Inspections have multiple Defects
- Equipment performs Inspections
- Users manage all entities

## üîå API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
